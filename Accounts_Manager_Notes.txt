Install OpenSSL Development Libraries:

Since the application uses OpenSSL for password hashing (SHA-256) and encryption (AES), install the OpenSSL development libraries with:

sudo apt -y install libssl-dev
Compiling the Program:

Once the necessary libraries are installed, you can compile the C program using gcc. Use the following command to compile the program:


gcc -o account_manager account_manager.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -lssl -lcrypto


sudo cp account_manager /usr/local/bin/account_manager
